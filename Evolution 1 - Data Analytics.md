# Evolution 1 - Data Analytics


The data that is available in today’s digital world is ever expanding, this is not just limited to business dealings but it is also growing more prominent in our personal lives as well. That means that Data Analytics will continue to play a crucial role in the business world going forward. At the heart of all analytics resides the scientific method and with the ultimate end goal of data analytics is to provide organizations and individuals with evidence to enhance decision making. Analytics is used as a tool to help organizations and individuals make better decisions by providing evidence based on analyzing history and even trying to make predictions on what will happen based on sed history. With such a wide array of available data, analytics is in play for all industries in some way, however that does not mean that it is a one size fits all solution. As Dr. Hugh Watson a University of Georgia professor observes, analytics is not just a list of software packages, mathematical formulas, or statistical techniques. It is unique to each individual industry and even unique to each individual organization. Because of this fact, one of the main frameworks of sound analytics results is industry and organizational knowledge. This allows organizations to mold their analytical activities to best fit their business needs. For example, national retailers would want to analyze things like staffing levels at stores, inventory levels at stores and distribution centers, and of course consumers and consumer behavior. In addition to adapting analytics to fit a specific organization it is also important that organizations are analyzing industry and economic trends. The organizational and industry knowledge also plays an enormous role in using data analytics to tell a story. Analytics are most effective when they tell a story, and are not just arbitrary numbers and figures. Visualization also plays a key role in telling a story and greatly helps convey the story you may be trying to tell.  It is key to remember that in a lot of cases that leaders who will be making decisions may not have the expertise of the team or individuals who run the analytics and it is crucial that the data tells a story that the average person would be able to understand. Now in theory, individuals in positions of leadership should have some sort of workable knowledge but it is still important to translate the information. Using data to tell a full story also provides more context and leads to more sound data based decisions which at the end of the day is the ultimate goal of data analytics. I feel extremely comfortable in understanding the strategies behind data analytics as well as the reasoning behind why analytics is used.
There are quite a few available tools that can help execute and visualize analytical activities including Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and Tableau. I have gained substantial experience in utilizing Tableau for analytics purposes, in the course CIDM 6308 as well as in my current role at work. Throughout the course(specifically the final project) I had the opportunity to learn the functionalities of Tableau and harness its capabilities to analyze and visualize data effectively. This final project also allowed me to get first hand experience on using data to tell a story and gave me a realistic idea of what it would be like to work on a project with a team.
This final project is attached as a PDF in this github repository as a part of my portfolio to show my work. My Tableau experience at work is more reporting creation and execution so not entirely analytical in nature however it is another example of full capabilities of some of these programs. While I have developed a strong foundation in Tableau, I acknowledge that my personal experience with Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics is limited. I consider both tools to be my weaknesses and areas for desired growth. Recognizing the significance of these analytics tools in the industry, I aim to expand my expertise in Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics to enhance my skill set. I do believe that it should be relatively easy to pick up (at the very least basics) due to my Tableau experience and general analytics knowledge, however I know the possibilities of both of these programs have almost limitless potential so I definitely have a lot to learn on both fronts. I aim to broaden my skill set in both programs which will make me a more valuable asset and candidate when looking for jobs post graduation. 
 Another tool I have a fair amount of experience using is the Python Pandas package in conjunction with other analytics based packages such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Bokeh and Statsmodels. This experience was mainly from the course CIDM 5310. We completed weekly Pandas assignments, as well as a large scale final project both of which are included in the Github repository. The Pandas assignments and knowledge stemmed from the textbook “The Pandas Workshop” by Blaine Bateman, Saikat Basak, Thomas V. Joseph and William So.  This course has allowed me to work on data change, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization skills using Pandas and its variety of potential complimentary packages. I found Pandas extremely useful when dealing with large datasets or different types of datasets. It is a good way to get multiple data sources in similar formatting. While these additional packages similar to Google and Adobe Analytics have seemingly endless potential and I believe while I have had a relatively decent amount of experience using these packages I am sure I barely scratched the surface of their capabilities. Additionally there are most certainly additional packages available that would be useful to learn. However, from my research when executing the final project for CIDM 5310, a lot of these packages can accomplish the same things so it is almost necessary to have an idea of what you are trying to create in terms of visualization or dashboards. While I am not sure I would call the lack of knowledge of additional packages a weakness it is certainly an opportunity. I am personally interested in learning about more packages to expand my repertoire of skills in turn making me a more desirable candidate in the future. 
My capabilities summary statement would be as follows, “I am fully confident in my understanding of why data analysis is conducted, the importance of using data analysis to tell a story and equally confident in my understanding that it is not a one size fits all process. I also fully understand that industry and organizational knowledge play a key role in data analysis. I have substantial experience using Tableau and the Python Pandas package, as well as other complementary analysis based Python packages, to help conduct my data analysis, create dashboards and other visualization methods.”
        Data analytics is only a piece of the total picture of this graduate program, and is intertwined deeply with the other 3 pillars of this program. Those other three pillars are, Data Management, Software Systems, and lastly Networking and Cybersecurity. Data analytics obviously goes hand in hand with data management as the data used in the analysis comes directly from this pillar. Data is cleaned, transformed, and stored under the data management process so it is imperative for data analysis that data management is handled correctly. Again the results you achieve from your analysis are only as good as the data you put in. Analytics also is very closely tied to software systems as in a lot of cases, certainly not all or even a vast majority, the software being developed is either for data analysis purposes or some form of data management. In those cases, softwares must be developed with the analysis or management goals in mind, and are curtailed to an organization’s specific data needs. Lastly, while analysis is not directly related or linked to the networking and cybersecurity pillar, the argument could be made that one of the main things being protected by cybersecurity is the data that an organization may analyze as well as the analysis itself. So at the very least there is a transitive connection between these two pillars. Regarding the final project as a whole, data analysis will be the meat as well as the heart of the story of the final project. While the other pillars almost work in service, providing the support needed to conduct the analysis itself.
